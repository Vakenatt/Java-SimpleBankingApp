# Java-SimpleBankingApp

This is my implementation of a task I got from ChatGPT.

> The app contains a Bank class that can store multiple Customer objects.

> Each customer has a name and a unique account number.

> A customer can perform the following actions:
>> - Deposit money into their account.
>> - Withdraw money from their account.
>> - Check their account balance.

> The app contains an error handling for cases like insufficient funds during withdrawals.
